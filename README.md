# PHPencil Framework

PHPencil is another php MVC web framework thought as a simple to understand php framework. The idea behind it is that common frameworks are getting to big and dependent on themselves, this one is as extendable and modifiable as the developers needs. The main features are:

  - Simple controller routing.
  - Easy to exteng Controllers.
  - Scalable structure.
  - For simple and big sites.

We think that this could be a nice starting point for new php projects that dont want to feel too big by using big frameworks and a lot of unused complexity.
