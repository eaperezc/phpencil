# PHPencil Framework

PHPencil is another php MVC web framework thought as a easy php framework. The idea behind it is that common frameworks are getting to big and crazy so I wanted to have a small framework that I can use for small projects without the need of installing a big framework. This one is as extendable and modifiable as the developers needs. The main features are:

  - Simple controller routing.
  - Easy to extend Controllers.
  - Scalable structure.
  - For simple and big sites.

We think that this could be a nice starting point for new php projects that don't want to feel too big by using big frameworks and a lot of unused complexity.

### Version
0.1 Beta

### Tech

PHPencil is using this widely used technologies:

* [Composer] - Dependency management system.
* [Twig] - Views Template engine.
* [PHP Active Record] - ORM library for the Models.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - For the examples (not required).
* [jQuery] - duh.

### Installation

Get the code and start using it:

```sh
// Fork this project first and then:
$ git clone https://github.com/<your_user>/phpencil.git myApp
$ cd myApp
$ composer update
```

### Plugins

We created some Sublime Snippets to help the creation of classes on the framework and some helpers. This way you don't have to worry about memorizing the code but just call this snippets and the code will be there for you to complete.

### Development

Want to contribute? Great! Get the code and start coding. All contributions will be deeply appreciated. More technical and complete documentation will come in the future.
